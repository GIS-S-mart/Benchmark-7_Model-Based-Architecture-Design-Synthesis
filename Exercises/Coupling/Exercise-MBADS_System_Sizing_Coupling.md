|      Angularity       |                  | The angle between two rotating axes at a given point. The angularity is expressed in terms of a slope in mils/mm (gap per diameter). The angularity multiplied by the coupling diameter gives an equivalent gap difference at the coupling rim.<br />![image-20231207153558971](./Images/image-20231207153558971.png) | [Source](https://backflowparts.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Shaft_Alignment_Instructions.pdf) |
|        Offset         |                  | The distance between two rotating axes at a given point. Offset is measured in mm.<br />![image-20231207153723897](./Images/image-20231207153723897.png)<br />Offset is sometimes incorrectly referred to as parallel offset or rim misalignment. However, the shaft rotation axes are rarely parallel, and the coupling or shaft rim has an unknown relationship to the shaft rotation axes. The same alignment condition, the offset value varies depending upon the location where the distance between two shaft rotation ration axes is measured.<br /><br />![image-20231207153913381](./Images/image-20231207153913381.png) | [Source](https://backflowparts.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Shaft_Alignment_Instructions.pdf) |

## 2. Introduction

This benchmark exercise aims to evaluate - competitive or complementary - contributions claiming to improve the Model-Based Architecture Design Synthesis (MBADS) process for system sizing. 

In this benchmark exercise, the overall objective of the Model-Based Architecture Design Synthesis Process is to size the Coupling Bolt System defined in Section 3. The candidate solutions can support an engineer throughout the end-to-end MBADS process or for a specific activity.

Section 4 specifies the design inputs for each activity of the MBADS process. All candidate solutions must reuse these design inputs to make fair comparisons.

- Section 4.1 defines the inputs of the Requirements Development activity.
- Section 4.2 defines the inputs of the Concept Finding activity.
- Section 4.3 defines the inputs of the Problem Modelling activity.
- Section 4.4 defines the inputs of the Problem Solving activity.

## 3. System-Of-Interest

The system-of-interest is a rigid flange Coupling Bolt System. A Coupling Bolt System is a mechanical means of holding two halves of a flanged shaft together to transfer the torque while maintaining shaft alignment.

## 4. Design Inputs

The design inputs are defined in a generic format, that is, without a specific modelling language and software, leaving the contributors to choose to use their preferred solutions for encoding the data.

### *4.1. Requirements Development*

- [ ] **Design Inputs:**
  - 1 system context
  - 1..* system functions
- [ ] **Design Outputs:**
- 1..* requirements
- 1..* design constraints

**System Context**

A system context includes the external environment in which the system must operate. The external environment includes external entities stakeholders with which the system must interact. For this benchmark exercise, we only consider the operational context of the Coupling Bolt System. A more exhaustive system analysis would also consider other contexts related to other phases of the Coupling Bolt System life cycle (e.g., maintenance phase) that are additional sources of constraints and functions.

**System Functions**

The Coupling Bolt System shall perform a set of functions:

|  ID  | Function                                                     |
| :--: | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|  F1  | To transfer torque from the driving shaft to the driven shaft. |
|  F2  | To maintain the vertical angularity between the driving shaft and the driven shaft. |
|  F3  | To maintain the vertical offset between the driving shaft and the driven shaft. |
|  F4  | To maintain the horizontal angularity between the driving shaft and the driven shaft. |
|  F5  | To maintain the horizontal offset between the driving shaft and the driven shaft. |

### *4.2. Concept Finding*

- [ ] **Design Inputs:**
  - 1..* requirements
