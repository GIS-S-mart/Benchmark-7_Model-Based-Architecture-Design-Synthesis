## Glossary

An agreed-upon glossary of terms used in this benchmark is proposed below. Contributors should reuse existing terms and definitions from existing standards and not invent new ones, unless they have a very specific concept that requires the introduction of a new keyword and definition. Any new keyword and definition must be motivated and explained in the discussion of the repository (e.g. navigate to '*Repositories > Benchmark-0_Template > Discussions*', or [click here](../discussions)).

## Research objectives

The primitive research objective pursued by the benchmark community is improving the concept finding activity in a Model-Based Architecture Design Synthesis process for system sizing.

The metrics used to measure how well the research objectives are satisfied are defined as follows:

|                          **Metric**                          | **Definition** |     **Unit**     |

Authors should use existing metrics and not invent new ones, unless they measure additional aspects not covered by existing ones. Any change to existing empirical evidence must be motivated and explained in the discussion of the repository (e.g. navigate to '*Repositories > Benchmark-0_Template > Discussions*', or [click here](ttps://github.com/GIS-S-mart/Benchmark-7_Design_synthesis-3_Concepts_finding/discussions). Once the suggested change is informally approved by the community, the author shall post on the issues page of the benchmark (e.g. navigate to '*Repositories > Benchmark-0_Template > Issues*', or [click here](ttps://github.com/GIS-S-mart/Benchmark-7_Design_synthesis-3_Concepts_finding/issues)) and briefly outline the new metric.

## Body of knowledge

The body of knowledge is the background knowledge upon which researchers will draw on and contribute in theory or practice. Regarding the activity of concept finding, the background knowledge is relatively broad and vaguely known under different names, such as embodiment design, conceptual design, preliminary design, [...], or system architecture design. Existing works include:

- Albers, A., Sedchaicharn, K., Sauter, C., & Burger, W. (2009). A Method to define a Product Architecture Early in Product Development Using the Contact and Channel Model. In *DS 58-5: Proceedings of ICED 09, the 17th International Conference on Engineering Design, Vol. 5, Design Methods and Tools (pt. 1), Palo Alto, CA, USA, 24.-27.08. 2009* (pp. 241-252).
- Pailhès, J., Sallaou, M., Nadeau, J. P., & Fadel, G. M. (2011). Energy based functional decomposition in preliminary design.
- Suh, N. P., & Suh, N. P. (2001). *Axiomatic design: advances and applications* (Vol. 4). New York: Oxford university press.

This benchmark focuses on a more narrow scope limited to the design approaches supporting the concept finding activity with a model-based approach, which could be part of a Model-Based Architecture Design Synthesis process for automatic solving. Existing works include:

- Albert, A., & Christian, Z. (2013). Extending SysML for engineering designers by integration of the contact & channel–approach (C&C2-A) for function-based modeling of technical systems. *Procedia Computer Science*, *16*, 353-362.

- Barbedienne, R., Messaoud, Y. B., Choley, J. Y., Penas, O., Ouslimani, A., & Rivière, A. (2015, September). SAMOS for Spatial Architecture based on Multi-physics and Organisation of Systems in conceptual design. In *2015 IEEE International Symposium on Systems Engineering (ISSE)* (pp. 135-141). IEEE.
- Kharrat, M., Penas, O., Plateaux, R., Trabelsi, H., Choley, J. Y., Louati, J., & Haddar, M. (2017, October). Towards a 3D conceptual architecture framework, based on multi-physical constraints. In *2017 IEEE International Systems Engineering Symposium (ISSE)* (pp. 1-8). IEEE.

However, the design inputs and outputs of the concept finding activity depend on the objective of the Model-Based Architecture Design Synthesis process. This benchmark concentrates on the activity of MBADS for system sizing, which further limits the body of knowledge, although all related works are of interest.
